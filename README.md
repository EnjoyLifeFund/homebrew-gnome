Homebrew-Gnome
--------------

This repo contains a few extra packages from the gnome project.
It may also contain a few non-gnome packages that depend on these packages
or personal packages I use.

It also contains versions of gtk+ built against the Quartz backend instead of X11.
Note that these conflict with the main homebrew repo.

Using
-----

```
brew tap TingPing/gnome
brew install TingPing/gnome/gtk+3
```

Read the [wiki](https://github.com/TingPing/homebrew-gnome/wiki) for more information
on configuration you will need for things such as proper theming.
